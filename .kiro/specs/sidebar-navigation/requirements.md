# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing functional navigation for the sidebar menu in the QA Portfolio website. Currently, the sidebar contains navigation links but lacks the JavaScript functionality to handle smooth scrolling and active state management when users click on navigation items. The goal is to create a fully functional navigation system that provides smooth scrolling to sections and visual feedback for the current page position.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the portfolio website, I want to click on sidebar navigation items and be smoothly scrolled to the corresponding section, so that I can quickly navigate to different parts of the portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a sidebar navigation button THEN the page SHALL smoothly scroll to the corresponding section
2. WHEN the smooth scrolling occurs THEN it SHALL take an appropriate duration (not too fast or slow)
3. WHEN navigation is triggered THEN the target section SHALL be properly positioned in the viewport
4. WHEN clicking navigation items THEN the browser URL SHALL update to reflect the current section (hash navigation)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating through the portfolio, I want the sidebar to show which section I'm currently viewing, so that I have visual feedback about my current location on the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls through the page THEN the sidebar SHALL highlight the navigation item corresponding to the currently visible section
2. WHEN a section comes into view THEN the corresponding sidebar button SHALL receive an "active" visual state
3. WHEN scrolling between sections THEN only one navigation item SHALL be active at a time
4. WHEN the page loads with a hash in the URL THEN the corresponding navigation item SHALL be marked as active

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the sidebar navigation to work properly on touch devices, so that I can navigate the portfolio effectively on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the mobile sidebar menu THEN clicking navigation items SHALL trigger smooth scrolling
2. WHEN navigation occurs on mobile THEN the sidebar menu SHALL automatically close after navigation
3. WHEN smooth scrolling happens on mobile THEN it SHALL account for mobile viewport differences
4. WHEN using touch gestures THEN the navigation SHALL respond appropriately without conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the navigation to be keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly, so that I can navigate the portfolio using assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN users SHALL be able to tab through sidebar navigation items
2. WHEN pressing Enter or Space on a navigation item THEN it SHALL trigger navigation to the corresponding section
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN navigation items SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and roles
4. WHEN focus moves to navigation items THEN there SHALL be clear visual focus indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that the website remains functional even when sections are missing or the layout changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a navigation target section doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without breaking
2. WHEN the page layout changes dynamically THEN the navigation SHALL continue to work correctly
3. WHEN multiple rapid clicks occur THEN the navigation SHALL handle them smoothly without conflicts
4. WHEN the browser doesn't support smooth scrolling THEN a fallback navigation method SHALL be provided
