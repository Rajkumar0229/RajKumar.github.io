# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on extending the hero section's dynamic background system to all sections of the QA Portfolio website. Currently, only the hero section has a dynamic background with slideshow functionality, while other sections use semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop blur. The goal is to create a consistent, visually appealing background system that works across all sections while maintaining readability and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the portfolio website, I want all sections to have visually consistent and engaging backgrounds similar to the hero section, so that the entire website feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls through different sections THEN each section SHALL have an appropriate background that matches the overall design theme
2. WHEN viewing any section THEN the background SHALL not interfere with text readability or content visibility
3. WHEN transitioning between sections THEN the background changes SHALL be smooth and visually appealing
4. WHEN the background system is active THEN it SHALL maintain the existing visual hierarchy and content structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the background system to be dynamic and engaging like the hero section, so that the website feels modern and interactive throughout my browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the background system is implemented THEN it SHALL include dynamic elements such as particle effects or subtle animations
2. WHEN viewing different sections THEN the background MAY change to reflect the content theme (e.g., different colors or patterns for different sections)
3. WHEN the user interacts with the page THEN the background SHALL respond appropriately without being distracting
4. WHEN animations are present THEN they SHALL be smooth and not cause performance issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the background system to work well across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the background system SHALL be optimized for performance and battery life
2. WHEN using touch devices THEN the background SHALL not interfere with touch interactions or scrolling
3. WHEN on slower devices THEN the background system SHALL gracefully degrade to maintain performance
4. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the background SHALL adapt appropriately to the new dimensions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the background system to not interfere with content readability or cause motion sensitivity issues, so that I can comfortably use the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the background system is active THEN text content SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios for readability
2. WHEN animations are present THEN users SHALL have the option to reduce motion based on their system preferences
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the background system SHALL not interfere with assistive technology
4. WHEN the background includes moving elements THEN they SHALL not cause seizures or vestibular disorders

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the background system to enhance the content presentation without overwhelming it, so that I can focus on the portfolio information while enjoying the visual design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing content sections THEN the background SHALL provide subtle enhancement without competing with the main content
2. WHEN reading text content THEN the background SHALL use appropriate opacity and blur effects to ensure readability
3. WHEN viewing images or projects THEN the background SHALL complement rather than clash with the content
4. WHEN the background system is disabled THEN the website SHALL remain fully functional and visually acceptable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want the background system to be performant and not negatively impact page load times or user experience, so that the website remains fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the background system loads THEN it SHALL not significantly increase the initial page load time
2. WHEN animations are running THEN they SHALL maintain 60fps performance on modern devices
3. WHEN multiple background elements are active THEN memory usage SHALL remain within acceptable limits
4. WHEN the system detects poor performance THEN it SHALL automatically reduce background complexity or disable non-essential effects
