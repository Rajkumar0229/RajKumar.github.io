# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing text display and readability for mobile devices in the QA Portfolio website. The current implementation has text that may overflow, be too small, or not properly adapt to different mobile screen sizes. The goal is to ensure all text content fits properly within mobile viewports while maintaining readability and visual hierarchy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user visiting the portfolio website, I want all text content to be properly sized and fit within my screen, so that I can read the content without horizontal scrolling or zooming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the website on a mobile device (320px-768px width) THEN all text SHALL fit within the viewport without horizontal overflow
2. WHEN text content is displayed on mobile THEN the font sizes SHALL be appropriately scaled for mobile readability
3. WHEN viewing long paragraphs on mobile THEN the text SHALL wrap properly without breaking the layout
4. WHEN the user rotates their device THEN the text SHALL adapt to the new orientation without layout issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want headings and body text to maintain proper visual hierarchy on small screens, so that I can easily scan and understand the content structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing headings on mobile devices THEN they SHALL maintain relative size differences while being appropriately scaled
2. WHEN displaying the hero section on mobile THEN the main heading SHALL be readable without being too large for the screen
3. WHEN viewing section headings THEN they SHALL be proportionally smaller than the hero heading but larger than body text
4. WHEN text content includes lists or structured data THEN the hierarchy SHALL remain clear on mobile devices

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want adequate spacing and line height for text content, so that I can comfortably read long sections without eye strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing body text on mobile THEN the line height SHALL provide comfortable reading spacing
2. WHEN text blocks are displayed THEN there SHALL be appropriate margins and padding for mobile touch interfaces
3. WHEN viewing lists or bullet points THEN they SHALL have proper indentation and spacing for mobile readability
4. WHEN multiple text sections are displayed THEN there SHALL be clear visual separation between sections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user with different screen sizes, I want the text to adapt responsively across various mobile devices, so that the content is optimized for my specific device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on small mobile devices (320px-480px) THEN text SHALL use the smallest appropriate font sizes
2. WHEN viewing on medium mobile devices (481px-768px) THEN text SHALL use intermediate font sizes
3. WHEN the viewport width changes THEN text sizes SHALL transition smoothly between breakpoints
4. WHEN viewing on high-DPI mobile screens THEN text SHALL remain crisp and readable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want interactive text elements like links to be appropriately sized for touch interaction, so that I can easily tap them without accidentally selecting adjacent elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text contains links THEN they SHALL have adequate touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
2. WHEN links are displayed in paragraphs THEN they SHALL have sufficient spacing from surrounding text
3. WHEN viewing project links or contact information THEN they SHALL be easily tappable on mobile devices
4. WHEN multiple links are grouped together THEN they SHALL have clear separation for accurate touch interaction
